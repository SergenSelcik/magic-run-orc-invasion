      <strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><br>
      <strong><span>Liability for Links</span></strong>
      <p>
         Our site contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence.
         Therefore,
         we
         cannot
         assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always
         responsible
         for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
         linking.
         Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the content of the
         linked
         pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. Upon becoming aware of legal
         violations,
         we will
         remove such links immediately.
      </p>
      <strong><span>Data Protection</span></strong>
      <p>
         The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. As far as on our
         pages
         personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected, this is always done on a voluntary basis.
         These
         data
         will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
         We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have
         security
         gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
         The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending
         unsolicited
         advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly
         reserve
         the
         right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam
         e-mails.
